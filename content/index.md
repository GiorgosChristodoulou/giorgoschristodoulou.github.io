## Georgios (George) Christodoulou 
<div align='justify'>
I received my diploma in Computer Science and Engineering from the <a href='https://www.cse.uoi.gr/?lang=en'>Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Ioannina</a> in 2017. I received my MSc in Computer Science with specialization in software from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Ioannina in 2020. I received my PhD from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Ioannina in 2023, supervised by <a href='https://www.cs.uoi.gr/~nikos/indexb.html'>Prof. Mamoulis</a> and  <a href='https://pbour.github.io/'>Prof. Bouros</a>. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href='https://www.tudelft.nl/'>TU Delft</a>.

## Research Interest
<div align='justify'>
My research centers on advancing scalable, efficient data management systems with a particular emphasis on complex data, stream processing, and distributed systems. My PhD work focused on novel indexing solutions for both static interval data and streams of temporal data, addressing the challenges of efficient data indexing and retrieval. In my current postdoctoral research at TU Delft, I am exploring the intersection of streaming dataflow systems, transactions, and scalable data management.
